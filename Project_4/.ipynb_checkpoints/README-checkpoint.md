# Capstone Project: Create a Shakespeare Machine Learning Model to Generative Text

### Overview
This project aims to create a Shakespeare machine learning model and use that model to generate a set of new Shakespearean text.

### Background
William Shakespeare, is considered the greatest English poet and playwright in world literature. He is also considered the greatest dramatist of all time as well as the most influential writer in the history of the English language. He remains vital because his plays represent people and situations that are recognizable today. His characters have an emotional reality that transcends time, and his plays represent familiar experiences, from family squabbles to falling in love to war. Considering that his plays are performed and adapted around the world shows the significant universal appeal of his storytelling. He created hundreds of words and phrases that English speakers use today;approximately 1700 unique words into the English language; and contributed to the standardization of the English grammar, language, spelling, vocabulary and literature.

### Problem Statement
- Mr Dorian Gray is teaching English literature to lower secondary school students who are born in the digital age and are tech-savvy. The school's direction to teachers is to incorporate technology in most of their lesson where possible. As such, Mr Dorain Gray who has a background in data science before his career switch as a teacher, deciced to create a Shakespeare machine learning model a.k.a Shakespeare Bot. The intent is to imbue some interest in his students in Shakespeare's literary works, while incorporating machine learning into it.
- To kickstart, My Dorian Gray will develop a baseline Shakespeare Bot that is able to regenerate text from the machine learning model. Factoring that he has been out-of-touch with the data science commmunity, and with the time-constraint, he has scope his Shakespeare Bot to learn from the list of Shakespeare's plays and thereafter regenerate 1000 characters of Shakespeare's text, as a baseline.
- Assuming, his baseline Shakespeare Bot is successful, his larger goal is to feed modern literary works such as Avengers playscript into the Shakespeare Bot. 
- In summary, My Dorian Gray will be creating a baseline Shakespeare Bot that learns from the list of Shakespeare's plays and regenerate 1000 characters of Shakespeare's text.

### Datasets Used

1. Complete Works of Shakespeare Plays by Project Gutenberg

---

### Methodology
1. Reccurent Neural Network
Use the recurrent neural network (RNN) to build a learning machine model from a list Shakespearean plays and generate meaningful text from the model. The neural network model will learn from the vectors that are generated from the Shakespearean text. LTSM and GRU methods will be explored to indentify which is better. 

2. Transformer

### Proposed Timeline
- 15-21 Apr 23 : Research (1 week)
- 24-30 Apr 23 : Study dataset, data cleaning and perform EDA (1 week)
- 1-15  May 23 : Create machine learning model, test-run, make improvements, generate text, mid-point check-in with TA (2 weeks)
- 17-19 May 23 : Create readme, powerpoint slides (3 days)
- 20-21 May 23 : Rehearse presentation narrative (2 days)
-    22 May 23 : Upload on Git (1 day)
-    23 May 23 : Presentation weeek

### Outcome
- Generate 1000 characters of Shakespeare words using the machine learning model.
